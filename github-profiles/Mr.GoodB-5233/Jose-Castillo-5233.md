# 🖥️ Terminal Commands Reference

## Basic Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `📂 ls`    | Lists the files and directories in the current directory. |
| `📁 cd`    | Changes the current directory to another specified directory. |
| `📝 mkdir` | Creates a new directory in the current directory or in another specified directory. |
| `🗑️ rm`    | Deletes files and directories. |
| `✂️ cp`    | Copies files and directories from one place to another. |

## Command Aliases

An alias is an alternate name for a command. You can create your own aliases to make frequently used commands shorter and easier to remember. Here are some examples:

| Alias | Original Command | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| `📜 ll`  | `ls -la`        | Lists all files and directories, including hidden files, and shows additional information such as permissions and owners. |
| `🆑 c`   | `clear`         | Clears the terminal screen. |

To create these aliases, add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file (depending on your system):
alias ll='ls -la'
alias c='clear'
Once you've added these lines, you can use `ll` instead of `ls -la` and `c` instead of `clear`. Feel free to create more aliases to make your work in the terminal more efficient and productive.
